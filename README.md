# Sass ➡️ Jss Loader

### Takes your Sass files and converts into ES6 modules.

> This is an experimental loader to explore a theming solution for React that supports the use of Sass variables.

The default export of the module is a JSS style object. It works with the react-jss module. 

It also exports a `themeFactory`, which returns a new JSS object with any of the Sass variables replaced.
